This is a piece that I did about homelessness in Salt Lake City, more specifically in the Rio Grande neighborhood. From 2013-2016, I worked at the Gateway Mall, and got an up close and personal glimpse of just how bad the problem is. The city and state governments have taken steps to provide help to these people, but there is still a long ways to go. Hopefully with more awareness, larger strides can be made in the fight to wipe out homelessness in Salt Lake City for good.
